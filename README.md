# Makers BnB

Our first group project in which we were to design a clone of Airbnb with no guidance from the coaches in terms of how to approach the task, what technology stack to use or how to organise and plan our week. Below are the main requirements for the application.

# Headline specifications

* Any signed-up user can list a new space.
* Users can list multiple spaces.
* Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.
* Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
* Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the  user that owns that space.
* Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.
* Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.

# Our Initial Approach

At first we felt a little lost, unsure what task to attack first. Should we plan our week out, decide what front-end and back-end languages we were going to use, start diagramming? In the end it made sense initially decide the tech stack as that would help identify our next steps. There was talk of using Node.js but with the added pressure of being let loose on our own, it made more sense to stick to what we know and not have to hit the books (so to speak) first.

So we went with Ruby using Sinatra as our DSL. This also meant that we would be using Rspec and Capybara as our testing frameworks that we have good experience with already.

Next came planning our week/days. We spent the first day planning how we would like the website to look and function which took many forms!

# Our initial diagrams:

Our first thoughts in terms of Ruby classes:

Alice, one of our coaches was also kind enough to have a call with our group to discuss potentially using some Javascript on our front-end and how that would work. This is what came of that session which was super useful!

Sophie was able to use her amazing design talents to mockup how the site may look:

We decided to use a Trello board to stay in top of tasks, which worked really well:

</p><br><br>

After our first day and half coding it wasn't clear what the entire application looked like and how the backend communicated with the front end. So in a bid to get the entire team working as one we took some time to do a full mock-up ensuring that all members had a grasp of functionality:

# Learnings

We realised that working as part of a team is not as easy as it sounds when you have to organise and guide yourselves. We had a mix of pairing sessions to make some good headway on the code and then some group mobbing sessions to bring everyone up to speed.

We initially maintained very good code quality with regular tests but then the end of the week was taken up with group CSS sessions trying to get it to look pretty with a lot of trial and error!

We worked fantastically well as a group and our main aim was to ensure that we communicated with each other at all times and if anyone was struggling or unsure of anything we took the time to come together and talk it through.
